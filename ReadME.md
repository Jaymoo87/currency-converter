# Currency Converter App

This is a simple currency converter app that allows users to convert between different currencies.

## Features

The app has the following features:

- Currency conversion: Users can convert between different currencies using real-time exchange rates.
- User-friendly interface: The app has a simple and intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to use.
- Currency selection: Users can select the currency they want to convert from and the currency they want to convert to.
- Real-time exchange rates: The app uses real-time exchange rates to ensure that the conversions are accurate.
- Offline support: The app stores exchange rates locally, so it can still perform conversions even when the user is offline.

## Structure

The app is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the app's UI elements.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the app's logic.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains the app's styling.

The app uses the [Fixer.io API](https://fixer.io/) to fetch real-time exchange rates. The API requires an API key, which you can obtain by signing up for a free account on the [Fixer.io website](https://fixer.io/signup/free). Once you have obtained an API key, you can replace the placeholder value in the `script.js` file with your API key.

## How to Use

To use the app, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The app will load and display the current exchange rates. To perform a conversion, select the currency you want to convert from and the currency you want to convert to. Enter the amount you want to convert, and the app will display the converted amount.
